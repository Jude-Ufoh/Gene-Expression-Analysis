# Gene-Expression-Analysis
## Overview
Gene Expression data is the information that shows the genes that are actively producing mRNA in a particular cell, tissue, or organism at a specific point in time. the data helps in understanding the mechanisms underlying normal development, disease progression and responses to various environmental stimuli. RNA- sequencing is one of the three ways of obtaining gene expression data and it involves sequencing the entire transcriptome of a sample. The data obtained is analysed to understand gene expression, identify differentially expressed genes, and gain insights into biological processes and regulatory mechanisms.


## Procedures
- **Data Download**: Visit to the NCBI website [here](ncbi.nim.nih.gov).Select GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) and then download the GSE183947 dataset that contains RNA -seq data of breast cancer samples.Having selected the http option, the data is downloaded in a ,gz format which is then converted to csv. The csv file contains rows of file nrepresenting different genes and the columns representing different samples. The first column represents the gene names and the rest columns contains the gene expression levels in different formats.The gene expression levels are measured in FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) which is a normalised measure of gene expression. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8548e693-b6e6-4060-9b5a-52e35f44a377)
